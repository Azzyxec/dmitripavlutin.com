When Map were introduced in ES2015, I was always asking myself: what would be the best of use cases of it, so I could eliminitate the burden around plain JavaScript objects?

This post is going to describe typical cases when Map suits better than a plain JavaScript object.

## 1. The annoying thing about plain objects

## 2. The Map can have objects as a keys

## 3. The Map has O(1) size look-up

## 4. The Map is iterable

## 5. The Map has no restrictions over key names

## 6. Conclusion
