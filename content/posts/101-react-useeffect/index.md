When I first read about the new React hooks feature, I was impressed by the expressiveness and their possibilities.  

But the expressiveness and brevity of hooks comes with a price &mdash; it's relatively difficult to get started with them.  

I had difficulties in understanding the `useEffect()` hook: the one that manages side-effects inside of your React
components.  

While you'll read some theory of `useEffect()` in the first section, in this post I'll put accent on explaining `useEffect()` from interesting examples and demos.
