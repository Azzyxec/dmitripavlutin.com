There are JavaScript features that wastly change the way you code. Starting ES2015 and beyond, the features that influenced my code are destructuring, arrow functions, classes, and modules system.  

As of August 2019, a new proposal named optional chaining reached stage 3, and is going to be a nice improvement. Optional chaining changes the way proprties are accessed in deep objects structures. 

Let's see how optional chaining makes your code simpler by removes boilerplate conditionals and variables when accessing potentially missing properties from deep.  

## 1. Easy deep access of properties

## 2. Short-circuiting: stopping on *null/undefined*

## 3. Default with nullish coalescing

## 4. *await*-ing optional method

## 5. When not to use optional chaining

## 6. Why do I like it?
