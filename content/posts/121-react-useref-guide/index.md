`React.useRef()` is a hook that solves 2 main issues.  

First, `useRef()` can hold mutable values that should persist between component renderings. Secondly, `useRef()` is used to access DOM elements directly.  

In this post, I'll describe in detail how `useRef()` works in regards of these 2 categories of problems.  

## 1. Mutable values holder

Let's say you have a task to count how many times a component re-renders. The best way to hold such information is by creating a reference (in other words, a mutable value holder)

## 2. Access DOM elements

## 3. The rule of useRef()

## 4. Summary
