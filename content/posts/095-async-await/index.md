JavaScript has taken a long way to simplify the coding of async tasks.  

The first approach are the callbacks. When an async operation had been completed,
a special function named *callback* is called:

```javascript
asyncOperation(params, function callback(result) {
  // Called when the operation completes
});
```

But as soon as you handle multiple async operations, the callback functions nest into each other ending in a callback hell. That's the main problem of callbacks.  

A promise is placeholder object for results of an async task. With the use of promises you can handle the async operations easier.

```javascript
const promise = asyncOperation(params);

promise.then(function resolved(result) {
  // Called when the operation completes
});
```

Have you seen the  `.then().then()...then()` chains of promises ðŸš‚ðŸšƒðŸšƒðŸšƒðŸšƒ?  An issue of promises is their verbosity.  

Finally, the third attempt is the `async/await` syntax (starting ES2017). It let's you write async code in a concise and sync manner, solving the verbosity of promises:    

```javascript
(async function() {
  const result = await asyncOperation(params);
  // Called when the operation completes
})();
```

In this post I'm going to explain, step by step, how to use `async/await` in JavaScript.  

**Note**: *`async/await` is a syntactic sugar on top of promises*. I recommend getting familiar with [promises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-promises-explained/) before continuing.  

## 1. The synchronous addition

Because the title of the post says about an *interesting* explanation, I'm going to gradually explain how `async/await` works.  

Let's start with a simple (synchronous) function which task is to calculate the salary increase:

```javascript
function increaseSalary(base, increase) {
  const newSalary = base + increase;
  console.log(`New salary: ${newSalary}`);
  return newSalary;
}

increaseSalary(1000, 100); // => 1100
```

`increaseSalary()` is a function that sums 2 numbers. `n1 + n2` is a synchronous operation.   

The boss doesn't want a quick increase of employee's salary â˜¹. So you're not allowed to use the addition operator `+` in `increaseSalary()` function. 

Instead, you have to use a slow function that requires 2 seconds to summarize numbers. Let's name the function `slowAddition()`:

```javascript
function slowAddition(n1, n2) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(n1 + n2), 2000);
  });
}

slowAddition(1, 5).then(sum => console.log(sum));
// After 2 seconds logs "6"
```

`slowAddition()` returns a promise, which resolves to the sum of arguments after a delay of 2 seconds.  

How to update the `increaseSalary()` function to support the slow addition?

## 2. The asynchronous addition

The first naive attemtp is to replace the `n1 + n2` expression with a call to `slowAddition(n1, n2)`:

```javascript{2}
function increaseSalary(base, increase) {
  const newSalary = slowAddition(base, increase);
  console.log(`New salary: ${newSalary}`);
  return newSalary;
}

increaseSalary(1000, 100); // => [object Promise]
// Logs "New salary [object Promise]"
```

Unfortunately, the function `increaseSalary()` doesn't know how to handle the promise.  

Now it's the right time to make the `increaseSalary()` aware about the async function `slowAddition()` using the `async/await` syntax.  

First, you need to add the `async` keyword near the function declaration. Then, inside the function body, you need to use the `await` operator to make the function *wait* for the promise to be resolved before continuing.  

Let's make these changes to `increaseSalary()` function:

```javascript{1-2}
async function increaseSalary(base, increase) {
  const newSalary = await slowAddition(base, increase);
  console.log(`New salary: ${newSalary}`);
  return newSalary;
}

increaseSalary(1000, 100); // => [object Promise]
// After 2 seconds logs "New salary 1100"
```

JavaScript does the following when reaches the expression `const newSalary = await slowAddition(base, increase)`:

1. Pauses `increaseSalary()` function execution (in a non-blocking manner) 
2. *Waits* 2 seconds until the promise returned by `slowAddition(base, increase)` is resolved
3. `newSalary` variable is assigned with the resolve value `1100` (`1000+100`)
4. Then `slowAddition()` function execution continues as usual, in a sync manner.  

Despite the fact that `return newSalary` returns the number `1100`, if you look at the actual value returned by the function `increaseSalary(1000, 100)` &mdash; it is still a promise!  

The function returned by an `async` function is always a promise, which resolves to the value returned by the function:

```javascript
increaseSalary(1000, 100).then(salary => {
  salary; // => 1100
});
```

`async` functions returning promises is a good thing because you can [nest](#4-nesting-asynchornous-functions) `async` function, and handle async tasks in a sync way.
