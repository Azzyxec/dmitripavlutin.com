JavaScript has taken a long way to simplify the coding of async tasks.  

The first approach are the callbacks. When an async operation had been completed,
a special function named *callback* is called:

```javascript
asyncOperation(params, function callback(result) {
  // Called when the operation completes
});
```

But as soon as you handle multiple async operations, the callback functions nest into each other ending in a callback hell. That's the main problem of callbacks.  

A promise is placeholder object for results of an async task. With the use of promises you can handle the async operations easier.

```javascript
const promise = asyncOperation(params);

promise.then(function resolved(result) {
  // Called when the operation completes
});
```

Have you seen the  `.then().then()...then()` chains of promises ðŸš‚ðŸšƒðŸšƒðŸšƒðŸšƒ?  An issue of promises is their verbosity.  

Finally, the third attempt is the `async/await` syntax (starting ES2017). It let's you write async code in a concise and sync manner, solving the verbosity of promises:    

```javascript
(async function() {
  const result = await asyncOperation(params);
  // Called when the operation completes
})();
```

In this post I'm going to explain, step by step, how to use `async/await` in JavaScript.  

**Note**: *`async/await` is a syntactic sugar on top of promises*. I recommend getting familiar with [promises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-promises-explained/) before continuing.  

## 1. The synchronous addition

Because the title of the post says about an *interesting* explanation, I'm going to gradually explain how `async/await` works.  

Let's start with a simple (synchronous) function which task is to calculate the salary increase:

```javascript
function increaseSalary(base, increase) {
  const newSalary = base + increase;
  console.log(`Your new salary is ${newSalary}`);
  return newSalary;
}

increaseSalary(1000, 100); // => 1100
```

`sum()` is a function that sums 2 numbers. `n1 + n2` is a synchornous operation, meaning that JavaScript thread is waiting (i.e. blocked) until the operation is completed.  

But imagine a situation that the addition operator `+` is not available in JavaScript. Instead you have to invoke an asynchonous function that requires 2 seconds (wow, that's slow!) to summarize the numbers. Let's name the function `slowAddition`:

```javascript
function slowAddition(n1, n2) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(n1 + n2), 2000);
  });
}
```

`slowAddition()` returns a promise, which resolves with the sum of arguments after a timeout of 2 seconds.
