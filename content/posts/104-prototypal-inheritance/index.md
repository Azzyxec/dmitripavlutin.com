I believe that you don't know JavaScript until you know prototypal inheritance. Prototypes greatly influence how objects work in JavaScript.

The prototypal inheritance is often asked during coding interviews since this knowledge is an indicator of how you know JavaScript.    

This guide will help you easily understand prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.  

## 1. Introduction

JavaScript has only primitives types, `null`, `undefined` and objects. A big world of objects. In JavaScript, contrary to languages like Java or PHP, thereâ€™s no concept of class that serves as a template to create objects.  

An object is a composable structure and consists of multiple properties: key and value pairs.  

For example, the following object `cat` contains 2 properties:

```javascript
const cat = { sound: 'Meow!', legs: 4 };
```

Since I'd like to reuse `legs` property in other objects, let's extract `legs` property into a specialized object `pet`:

```javascript{1}
const pet = { legs: 4 };

const cat = { sound: 'Meow!' };
```

That looks better.  

But I still want to have `legs` property on `cat`. How can you connect `cat` with `pet`?  

Inheritance can help you!

## 2. The prototype object

In JavaScript, an object can *inherit* properties of another object. The object from where the properties are inherited is named *prototype*.  

Following the example, you can make `pet` a *prototype* of `cat` which will then *inherit* `legs` property.  

The special property `__proto__` sets the prototype of the created object in an object literal. Let's use `__proto__` and make `pet` the prototype of `cat`:

```javascript
const pet = { legs: 4 };

const cat = { sound: 'Meow!', __proto__: pet };

cat.legs; // => 4
```

`legs` property inside `cat` is now an *inherited property*, thus you can easily access it `cat.legs`.  

`sound` property, on the other side, is an *own property* because it's defined directly on the object.

> The essence of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript: objects can inherit properties from other objects &mdash; the prototypes.  

You've probably wondered: why the need for inheritance in the first place?  

Inheritance solves the problem of data and logic duplication. By inheriting, objects can share properties and methods.  

For example, you could easily reuse `legs` property to create more pets:

```javascript
const pet = { legs: 4 };

const cat = { sound: 'Meow!', __proto__: pet };
const dog = { sound: 'Bark!', __proto__: pet };
const pig = { sound: 'Grunt!', __proto__: pet };

cat.legs; // => 4
dog.legs; // => 4
pig.legs; // => 4
```

`cat`, `dog`, and `pig` all reuse the property `legs`.  

*Note: `__proto__` is deprecated, but I'm using it for simplicity. In production code [Object.create()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) is recommended.*

### 2.1 Own vs inherited property

If an object has an own property and an inherited property with the same name, then JavaScript *always picks the own property*.  

In the following example `chicken` object has an own property `legs`, but also inherits a property with the same name `legs`:
```javascript
const pet = { legs: 4 };

const chicken = { sound: 'Cluck!', legs: 2, __proto__: pet };

chicken.legs; // => 2
```

`chicken.legs` evaluates to `2`, meaning that JavaScript picks the own property `legs` over the inherited `legs` from the prototype.

If you delete the own property, then JavaScript picks the inherited one!

```javascript
const pet = { legs: 4 };

const chicken = { sound: 'Cluck!', legs: 2, __proto__: pet };

chicken.legs; // => 2
delete chicken.legs; // no chicken were harmed!
chicken.legs; // => 4
```

## 3. The implicit prototype

When you create an object, and no prototype is explicitly set, JavaScript assigns an implicit prototype object specific to the type of object you've created.   

Let's look again at the `pet` object:

```javascript
const pet = { legs: 4 };

pet.toString(); // => `[object Object]`
```

`pet` has just one property `legs`, however, you can invoke the method `pet.toString()`. Where did `toString()` come from?  

When you've created the `pet` object, JavaScript has assigned to it an implicit prototype object. From this implicit prototype `pet` inherits `toString()` method:  

```javascript
const pet = { legs: 4 };

const petPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(pet);

pet.toString === petPrototype.toString; // => true
```

[Object.getPrototypeOf(object)]() is an utility function that returns the prototype of an object.  

## 4. The prototype chain

Let's go deeper and create an object `tail`, making it also a prototype of `pet`:

```javascript
const tail = { hasTail: true };

const pet = { legs: 4, __proto__: tail };

const cat = { sound: 'Meow!', __proto__: pet };

cat.hasTail; // => true
```

`cat` inherits the property `legs` from its direct prototype `pet`, and also, inherits `hasTail` from the prototype of its prototype.  

![Prototypes chain in JavaScript](./images/3.png)

When accessing a property `myObject.myProp`, JavaScript looks for `myProp` inside the own properties of `myObject`, then in the prototype of the object, then in the prototype's prototype, and so on until it encounters `null` as the prototype.  

Because prototypes can also have prototypes, JavaScript looks for inherited properties in the *chain of prototypes*.  

## 5. But JavaScript has classes!

You may be confused regarding the statement that JavaScript has only objects. You've probably already used the `class` keyword in JavaScript!

For example, you can write a class `Pet`:

```javascript
class Pet {
  legs = 4;

  constructor(sound) {
    this.sound = sound;
  }
}

const cat = new Pet('Moew!');

cat.legs;           // => 4
cat instanceof Pet; // => true
```

and create a `cat` when instantiating the class. 

The secret is that `class` syntax in JavaScript is [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) on top of prototypal inheritance. 

The above `class`-based code snippet is equivalent to the following:

```javascript
const pet = {
  legs: 4
};

function CreatePet(sound) {
  return { sound, __proto__: pet };
}
CreatePet.prototype = pet;

const cat = CreatePet('Moew!');

cat.legs;                 // => 4
cat instanceof CreatePet; // => true
```

`CreatePet.prototype = pet` assignment is necessary to make `cat instanceof CreatePet` evaluate to `true`.  

Being based on prototypes, still, when working with `class`-es you can completely forget about prototypes.  

## 6. Summary

In JavaScript, objects inherit properties from other objects &mdash; the prototypes. That's the idea of prototypal inheritance.  

JavaScript looks for inherited properties not only in the direct prototype of the object, but also in the prototype of the prototype, and so on in the chain of prototypes.  

While prototypal inheritance seems clumsy at first, when understanding it you could enjoy its simplicity and possibilities. *Objects inherit properties from objects* &mdash; what could be simpler?
