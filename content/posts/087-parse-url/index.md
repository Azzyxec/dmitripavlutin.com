A Uniform Resource Locator, abbreviated **URL**, is a reference to a web resource (web page, image, file). The URL specifies the resource location and a mechanism of retrieveing the resource (http, ftp, mailto).  

In simple words, the URL is an address where a specific web page (or an image) can be found.  

For example, here's the URL of this blog post:

```
https://dmitripavlutin.com/parse-url-javascript/
```

To access parts of the URL like the *hostname* (e.g. `dmitripavlutin.com`), or *pathname* (e.g. `/parse-url-javascript/`) you need to invoke a parsing function. A convinient and well supported by modern browsers parser is the `URL()` constructor.  

In this post, I'm going to show you the structure of an URL. Then, you're going to use the `URL()` constructor to easily pick parts of an URL like hostname, pathname, query, or hash.   

## 1. The structure of an URL

## 2. Access the *hostname*

## 3. Access the *pathname*

## 4. Access the *query*

## 5. Access the *hash*

## 6. Access other URL parts

## 7. Summary
