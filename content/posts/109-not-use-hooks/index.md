React hooks make the side-effects and state management easier. I've been enjoying working with hooks since the beginning.  

However, despite hooks simplicity, there are situations when you just can't understand why they don't work as you expect.  

In this post I will describe you situations how not to use React hooks, in simple words the common mistakes you might be doing when using them.  

## 1. Do Not change hooks invocation order

## 2. Do Not use stale data

## 3. Do Not use state for infrastructure data

## 4. Do Not forget to cleanup side-effects
