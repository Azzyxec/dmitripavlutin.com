Variables is one of the fundamental concepts that any developer must know in order to use a specific programming language.  

In JavaScript the concept of variables works around 3 types of declaration statements: `const`, `let`, and `var`.  

To make the learning easier, including easier to remember, I'm going to describe each statement using 4 phases: declaration, initilization, assignment and access. Each of the
3 statements (`const`, `let`, and `var`) create variables that behave differently exactly in these 4 phases.  

Let's get started.  

## 1. Variable identifier

Before getting into the variables statements, it is important to understand what a variable actually is.  

In simple terms, a variable is a placeholder for a value. A value in JavaScript can be either a primitive value or an object.  

Any variable has a *name*, but saying stricter this name is called *identifier*.
