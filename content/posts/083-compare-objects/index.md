It's simple to compare primitive values in JavaScript. What you need to do is use any of the available
eqality operators, for example the strict equality operator:

```javascript
'a' === 'c'; // => false
1   === 1;   // => true
```

Object have structured data, thus they are more difficult to compare. In this post, you will learn how to 
efficiently compare objects in JavaScript.  

## 1. Reference equality

## 2. Manual comparison

## 3. Shallow equality

## 4. Deep equality
