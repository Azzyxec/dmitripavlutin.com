You have decided to start an open source project. You have worked a few months on an interesting problem. Finally you wrote some notes in README.md and released the version 1.0. 

After a few weeks you might notice that the usage of your project is low. You've worked a lot for free, giving your best efforts, but in the end only a few people are interested in your project.  

How could that happen? And more importantly, what to do to make your open source project successful?  

I've built an open source library [vocajs.com](/announcing-voca-the-ultimate-javascript-string-library/) that managed to rise into the top trending repositories on GitHub. Along the way I learnt some important principlies of how to make a quality open source project. I want to share these ideas with you.  

## 1. No one cares about your project

First of all, as an author, you need to shift your thinking about open source. You might think that if you put a lot of effort in your project (library, tool, framework, etc) that's interesting to you, a lot of people are going to get interested as well.  

Unfortunately, that's far from truth...

It might sound harsh, but developers out there are only interested in *solving their own problems*. So when someone visits your repository, one is searching for a solution. 

## 2. Solve a real problem

Before even starting the open source project, before even writing the first line of code, you need to invest a lot of time in finding a real problem to solve.  

To summarize, a good open source project solves a problem that developers are actively searching for a solution.  

![Solve a problem](./images/problem-lightbulb-solution.jpg)

Regarding my experience, I decided to write a JavaScript string library. My main reasoning was that the existing at that time solutions were low quality, and that JavaScript by itself doesn't have a standard string library. 

I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about strings. Creating such a library might even be boring... But what's more important I found a decent problem to solve.  

What could be the strategies the find good problems to solve:

* Think about problems that you're experiencing yourself. Can you build a tool for this problem?  
* Think about open source projects that are widely used, but are not that good. It's perfectly ok to implement your own better solution


## 3. Excellent README.md and documentation

Ok, you followed my advice, found a decent problem and implemented a relatively good solution. Is it enough?  

Unfortunately, again, that's still not enough...

If your README.md file lacks quality documentation how to use your solution, no one is going to use your solution.  

You might think that developers are going to dive into your implementation and find by themselves how to use your tool. 

## 4. Put accent on quality

## 5. Images and showcases

## 6. Conclusion
