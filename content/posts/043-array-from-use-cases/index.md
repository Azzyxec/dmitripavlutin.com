In any programming language are features and functions that go beyound the basic usage in their possibilities. 

One such function in JavaScript is the `Array.from()`: a workhorse that can do lots of things to generate and transform arrays.  

In this post, I will describe 5 use cases that are both interesting and useful.  

Before starting, let's recall what `Array.from()` does: transforms an array-like or iterable object into an array. 

```javascript
Array.from(arrayLikeOrIterable[, mapFunction[, thisArgument]]);
```



## 1. Transform array-like object into array

## 2. Clone an array

## 3. Fill an array with values

Describe the difference with `Array.prototype.fill` -> It cannot create new instances of objects.

## 4. Generate ranges of numbers

## 5. Unique items of an array

## 6. Conclusion
