Alongside with the plain JavaScript object, the array is probably one of the most popular data structure. 

A widely used operation on array is the access of an element of the array by index:

```javascript
const fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'grape'];

const index = 1;
array[index]; // => 'apple'
```

The expression `array[index]` is named *array accessor*, which evaluates to the array item located at `index`.
