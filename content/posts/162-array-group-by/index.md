I have little experience in Ruby programming language, but many developers like it because of the rich 
standard utility libraries. For example, the [array in Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Array.html) has a huge number of methods.  

JavaScript step by steps also enriches its built-in library of methods. In one of the previous posts I described
the new [array.at()](/javascript-array-at/) method.
