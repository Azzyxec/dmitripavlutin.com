Test-driven development (aka TDD) consists of 3 phases: the red, the green and the refactor.  

The transition from green to refactor phase involves generalization of the code under test. Especially if you've been using the [faking technique](https://www.qwan.eu/2021/07/20/tdd-faking-cheating.html) in the green phase.   

The idea of triangulation is to create 2 assertions to trigger the creation of the generic code from a fake implementation. Let's see in more details how it works and how useful it could be.  

*Note: if you're not familiar with test-driven development, I recommend checking [TDD in JavaScript video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89Pl2Uok8xc) before continuing with the article.*
