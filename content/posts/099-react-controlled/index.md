There are 2 approaches to access the value of an input element in React.  

In the first approach, named *uncontrolled input*, you access the value from a reference to the input element.  

The second approach, which I like because it doesn't use references, is using a *controlled input*. Let's see how to design controlled inputs using React hooks.  

## 1. The controlled input

A web page consists of a list of employees' names. Your task is to add an input field on this page. When the user types into this field the list of employees is filtered by the names that contain the typed query.  

That's a good scenario when you can use a controlled input. Here's a possible implementation:

```jsx{2,4,15-17}
function FilteredEmployeesList({ employees }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  
  const onChange = event => setQuery(event.target.value);

  const filteredEmployees = employees.filter(name => {
    return name.toLowerCase().includes(query);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Employees List</h2>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={query} 
        onChange={onChange}
      />
      <div className="list">
        {filteredEmployees.map(name => <div>{name}</div>)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Open the [demo]() and enter a query in the input field. You'll see how the list of employees is filtered.  

Setting up the controlled input requires 3 steps.

### Step 1. Define the state that holds the input value

Define the state that's going to hold the controlled input value: `const [query, setQuery] = useState('')`.  

### Step 2. On change event handler

Then define an event handler that updates the state when the input value changes:

```javascript
const onChange = event => setQuery(event.target.value);
```

### Step 3. Assign the event handler and value to the input field

Finally, set on the input field the value attribute as the state value, as well attach the event handler: `<input type="text" value={query} onChange={onChange} />`. 

Now the input field is *controlled* because React sets the value of the input from the state.   

## 2. Debouncing the controlled input

You might notice in the previous implementation that as soon as you type a character into the input field, the list gets filtered right away. That's not always convenient because it distracts the user when typing the query. 

Let's improve the user experience with debouncing: when the user types the query, let's filter the list after a timeout of 400ms.  

Let's see a possible implementation of a debounced controlled input:

```jsx{1,5,10}
import { useDebouncedValue } from './useDebouncedValue';

function FilteredEmployeesList({ employees }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const debouncedQuery = useDebouncedValue(query, 400);
  
  const onChange = event => setQuery(event.target.value);

  const filteredEmployees = employees.filter(name => {
    return name.toLowerCase().includes(debouncedQuery);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Employees List</h2>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={query} 
        onChange={onChange}
      />
      <div className="list">
        {filteredEmployees.map(name => <div>{name}</div>)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Open the [demo](), then enter a query into the input field. The employees' list doesn't filter while you type, but after passing 400ms after the latest keypress.  

`debouncedQuery` is the state value used to filter the employees' list requires and is separate from the input value state. This is the debounced state value, and it changes differently than the input state.  

`debouncedQuery` state value is managed by a specialized hook `useDebouncedValue(query, 400) ` that implements the debouncing.  

Here's the implementation of `useDebouncedValue()`:

```javascript
export function useDebouncedValue(value, wait) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setTimeout(() => setDebouncedValue(value), wait);
    return () => clearTimeout(id);
  }, [value]);

  return debouncedValue;
}
```

## 3. Summary

The controlled input is a convenient technique to access the value of input fields in React. It doesn't use references and serves as a single source of truth to access the input value.  

Setting up a controlled input requires 3 steps:  

1. Create the state to hold the input value: `[val, setVal] = useState('')`
* Define the event handler to update the state: `onChange = event => setVal(event.target.value)`
* Attach the event handler and set `value` attribute on the input field: `<input onChange={onChange} value={val} />`.  

To debounce the changing value of the input you need to create a new state holding the debounced value. Use the specialized hook `debouncedQuery = useDebouncedValue(value, wait)`.  

*Do you prefer controlled or uncontrolled components?*
