A good practice when using string values from the input and textarea fields is to remove the whitespaces from the start and end of the strings.  

For example the user might write his first name like `'Dmitri'` into an input field. But also might introduce accidently
the value `'Dmitri '` &mdash; and the extra space wouldn't be visible inside the form on the web page.  

In this post, I'm going to describe what is exactly a whitespace and a line terminator character in JavaScript. Plus, you'll read how to trim strings, aka remove whitespaces and line terminator characters.  

## 1. The whitespace



## 2. The line terminator

## 3. *string.trim()*

## 4. *string.trimStart()* and *string.trimEnd()*

## 5. Conclusion
