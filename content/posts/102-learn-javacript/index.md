If you've just started learning JavaScript, you might be upset by the long journey.  

I had been in your situation, and I have taken this journey. In this post, I'm going to share
the principlies to learn JavaScript efficiently, and stay motivated to learn it along the way.  

## 1. Step by step

Stephen King is one of my favorite writers. He is very productive and has published about 61 novels. Many of these have been adapted into movies and TV series.  

When King was asked in an interview "How do you write?", he answered:

> One word at a time.

While the answer might be funny at first, it is a deep one.  

There are no shortucts or silver bullets to write a good book: you write one word at a time. Word by word, minute by minute, hour by hour until you complete the book.  

This principle applies to learning, including of the JavaScript language. There are no shortcuts or silver bullets on how to learn JavaScript: you need, step by step, to understand each concept of the language.  

## 2. Learn how it works for you

The good news are that in 2020 there plenty of ways you can learn JavaScript: from books, video courses, attending a bootcamp.  

I've always liked learning from books. Books let me understand the information in my own pace, easily re-read what I find hard to understand.  

The game changer book for me was reading from cover to cover [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527), the 6th edition. The book covers in an accessible manner the simple to advanced concepts of all JavaScript.  

It's not enough only to follow the book. You need a way to retain the information. 

If books are your thing, I recommend to start with any of the following:

* [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Most-Used-Programming-Language/dp/1491952024/), the 7th edition
* [Head First JavaScript Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X)

## 5. Pure JavaScript
