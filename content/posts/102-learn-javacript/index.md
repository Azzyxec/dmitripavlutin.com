If you've just started learning JavaScript, you might be upset by the long journey.  

I had been in your situation, and I have taken this journey. And in this post, I'm going to share
the principlies that has helped me to learn JavaScript.

## 1. Step by step

Stephen King is one of my favorite writers. He's been very productive through his career and has published about 61 novels. Many of these have been adapted into films and TV series.  

When King was asked in an interview "How do you write?", he answered:

> One word at a time.

While the answer might be funny at first, it is a deep one.  

There are no shortucts or silver bullets to write a good book: you write one word at a time. Word by word, minute by minute, hour by hour until you complete the book.  

This principle applies to learning, including of the JavaScript language. There are no shortcuts or silver bullets on how to learn JavaScript: you need, step by step, to understand each concept of the language.  

## 2. Learn how it works for you

## 3. Done is better than perfect

## 4. Don't cherry pick

## 5. Pure JavaScript
