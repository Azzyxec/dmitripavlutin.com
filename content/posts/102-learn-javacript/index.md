If you've just started learning JavaScript, you might be upset by the long journey.  

I had been in your situation, and I have taken this journey. In this post, I'm going to share
the principles to learn JavaScript efficiently, and stay motivated to learn it along the way.  

## 1. Step by step

Stephen King is one of my favorite writers. He is very productive and has published about 61 novels. Many of these have been adapted into movies and TV series.  

When King was asked in an interview "How do you write?", he answered:

> One word at a time.

While the answer might be funny at first, it is a deep one.  

There are no shortcuts or silver bullets to write a good book: you write one word at a time. Word by word, minute by minute, hour by hour until you complete the book.  

Step by step principle applies to learn too, including of the JavaScript language. There are no shortcuts or silver bullets on how to learn JavaScript: you need, step by step, to understand each concept of the language.  

## 2. Learn the way *you* like it

The good news is that in 2020 there plenty of ways you can learn JavaScript: by reading books, watching video courses, attending [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).  

### 2.1 Books

My preference is to learn from books. Books let you understand the information at your own pace, allow re-read what is difficult to understand.  

The game-changer for me in understanding JavaScript was reading from cover to cover [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527) (6th edition). The book teaches in an accessible manner all simple to advanced concepts of JavaScript.  

However, it's not enough only to read the book. You need a way to retain the information. I use these practices to solidify knowledge during reading:

1. Note important ideas in a notebook
2. Play with the JavaScript code snippets in a REPL

Here's a page with notes I had taken when reading "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide":

If books are your thing, I recommend the following:

* [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Most-Used-Programming-Language/dp/1491952024/) (7th edition)
* [Head First JavaScript Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X)
* [You Don't Know JS Book Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B01N9EBP9V)

### 2.2 Video courses

Video courses have the benefit of being more interactive than books.  

The course author can explain the difficult concepts in a human-understandable way. Plus, guided by the author, you can practice by creating real-world applications.  

A list of JavaScript beginner courses you might try:

* [The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/) (by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider)
* [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp ](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) (by Andrew Mead)

### 2.3 freeCodeCamp

You can also attend to learn JavaScript at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). Choose the course `JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification`. 

First, it's completely free. Second, you can achieve great results by learning JavaScript from there because it presents lessons, as well as exercises to solidify what you've learned.  

## 3. Done is better than perfect

Whatever option you've chosen to learn JavaScript &mdash; from a book, video course, or freeCodeCamp &mdash; complete it from *the start until the end*.  

It is vital to have a full fundamental knowledge of JavaScript. Having knowledge gaps is always going to slow you down and put into trouble. Half-knowledge is no knowledge.  

I know that sometimes, especially around the middle of the book or course, things can become *boring*. Or you can think that the explained feature *isn't needed*. Or you might want to *skip because it's complicated*. 

Resists the urge to abandon at the middle, and motivate yourself to complete until the end. It's OK if you don't' understand everything, it's OK if you still have questions: *done is better than perfect*.  

## 4. Don't cherry-pick

Long time I was working as a developer without having a solid understanding of JavaScript. I was cherry-picking information from random posts, Stackoverflow.  

Being tired of troubles because of knowledge gaps, I started reading "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" in detail. After understanding the features of JavaScript I had been so long having troubles, I was constantly telling myself: *why didn't I took this book much earlier and avoided all the troubles?*  

Don't make my mistake. Don't cherry-pick information about JavaScript fundamentals (keywords, syntax, expressions, variables, functions, closure, prototype, classes, objects). 

Follow a JavaScript fundamentals book or course, and complete it from the start until the end.  

## 5. Pure JavaScript

A specific of Frontend development, where JavaScript is involved, is the abundance of UI libraries and frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), and many more.  

A lot of beginner developers make the mistake of skipping JavaScript fundamentals, in the hope that a good UI library, like React, is going to compensate that.  

No UI library or framework is going to compensate the poor knowledge of JavaScript. Do deliberately learn pure JavaScript first.  

## 6. Tricks to stay motivated

Saying is easier than doing. Here's a list of tricks that allowed me to stay motivated and increased the efficiency of learning.  

### 6.1 Morning hours are the most productive

The morning hours (from 07:00 AM until 12:00 AM) are the most productive in learning. If you have the possibility, get up early morning, and commit to learning JavaScript during this timeframe.  

### 6.2 End the lesson on the most interesting moment

Sometimes, after a few dozens of learning sessions, you might find it complicated to motivate yourself to continue learning. 

I overcome this by closing the current learning session on the most interesting part, this way I have the interest and motivation to start next time.  

## 7. Summary

That's how I recommend getting started with JavaScript if you're a beginner. I've taken this path by myself, and hopefully, these practices are going to work for you too.
