It happens because reading object properties and accessing array items are frequent operations. The destructuring assignments make these operation so much easier and concise.  

In this post I will describe 5 interesting uses of destructuring in JavaScript, beyond the basic usage.  

## 1. Swap variables

## 2. Access nth array item

## 3. Cut the array head

## 4. Destructuring dynamic properties

## 5. Destructuring iterables

## 6. Conclusion
