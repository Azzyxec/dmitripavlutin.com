A confusing aspect of JavaScript language you would probably hear often is `this` keyword.  

`this`, named the function invocation conent, is confusing because it behaves differently depending on how the function is invoked.  

So, if you have hard time in determining the value of `this` keyword in a particular situation, I've created an easy algorithm for you to follow.  

While I've tried to make the algorithm as accessible as possible, I recommend reading it multiple times. Then follow the examples where the algorithm is put into practice &mdash; the examples help greatly to solidify the algorithm.  

Ready? Let's begin!  

## 1. *this* algorithm



## 2. Examples

### 2.1 Arrow function

### 2.2 Nested arrow function

### 2.3 Regular function invocation

### 2.4 *new* objects

## 3. Summary
