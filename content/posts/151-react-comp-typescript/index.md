In this post, I'm going to discuss why and how to use TypeScript to type React components.  


## 1. Why typing React components?

TypeScript is useful if you're coding middle size and bigger web applications.  

*Why?*

Because annotating variables, objects and functions with creates contracts between different parts of your 
application. 

*Why do contracts are useful?*

Because they constrain how a certain variable, object or function must be used.  

*Why does constraining is useful?*

Because constraining guides how to use a function the way its author has designed it.  

## 2. Typing props

### 2.1 *children* prop

### 2.2 Optional props

## 3. Return type

## 4. Typing state

## 5. Conclusion
