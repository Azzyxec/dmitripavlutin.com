The specifics of Frontend development is that you have to always monitor the bundle size of the application in order not to include too much libraries.  

However, a good part of software develpment consists of not reinventing the wheel: should I include that utility library (lodash, ramda, date-fns, etc) or should you write that utility function by yourself? 

That's a good question. I'm glad you're asking it yourself because no user likes to download megabytes of bundles.  

In this post you will find the reasons when you should include the utility libraries in your code. And more importantly, how to do it correctly in order to have the minimum bundle size as result.
