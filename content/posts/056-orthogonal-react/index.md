About 5 years ago, I was developing a cross-platform mobile application for an european startup. First series of features were easy to implement. I was progressing well and was happy about that.    

6 months passed by. More features were added on top of previous ones. Step by step, making new changes to existing modules became increasingly harder.  

At some point, I had started rejecting a part of new features or changes because they would require too much time to be implemented. The story had ended with a whole rewrite of the mobile apps to native platform, mainly because further maintainance would require too much costs.  

I blaimed the bugs in the cross-platform framework, blamed that client had been changing requirements, and so on. But these weren't the main problem.   

*I overlooked the importance of making my components easy to change.*  

## 1. Orthogonal components



## 2. The benefits of orthogonal design

## 3. Think in principles

## 4. Scenario 1: Making HTTP requests

## 5. Scenario 2: Is the component in view?

## 6. The "Main" component

## 7. The ballance

## 8. Key takeaway
