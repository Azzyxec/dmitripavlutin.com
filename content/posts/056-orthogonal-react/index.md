About 5 years ago, I was developing a cross-platform mobile application for an european startup. The implementation of first features was easy and straighforward. I was progressing well.  

About 6 months passed by. More features were added on top of previous ones. Step by step, I ended in a situation when making new changes to existing modules had required more and more time.  

At some point, I had started rejecting a part of new features and changes because they would require too much time to be implemented.  

## 1. Orthogonal components

## 2. The benefits of orthogonal design

## 3. Think in principles

> Think in principles, code with implementations.

## 4. Use case 1: Making HTTP requests

## 5. Use case 2: Is the component in view?

## 6. The "Main" component

## 7. The ballance

## 8. Key takeaway
