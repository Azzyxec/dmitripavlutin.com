The tech stack I'm currently working with is JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS. Plus I have experience in native iOS mobile development.   

I practice SOLID principles, Test-driven development (TDD), Domain-Driven Design, careful organization of system design in my daily coding challenges. 

I maintain an open source JavaScript library [vocajs.com](https://vocajs.com). From time to time I help fellow developers on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1894471/dmitri-pavlutin).
