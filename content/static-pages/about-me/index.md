# About me

My name is Dmitri Pavlutin. I'm a software developer who specializes in Frontend development.  

The tech stack I'm currently working with is JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS. Plus I have experience in native iOS mobile development.   

I practice approaches like SOLID, Test-driven development (TDD), Domain-Driven Design, carefully selecting the right system design.

In this blog I write regularly about my Frontend development experience. Writing helps me structuring my knowledge and get feedback. 

I maintain an open source JavaScript library [vocajs.com](https://vocajs.com). From time to time I help fellow developers on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1894471/dmitri-pavlutin).
