Certain data types (like strings) can have an infinite number of potential values , while others a resticted to a finite set of possible values.  

The days of the week, months of the year, seasons of the year are examples of sets having finite values. For example, the seasons set has four possible value: `Winter`, `Spring`, `Summer`, `Autumn`.  

If a variable in JavaScript must have a value from a finite set of values, then using an enum is pretty convinient.
